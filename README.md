# Awesome Vulnerability Research [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## ðŸ¦„ A curated list of the awesome resources about the Vulnerability Research

> First things first:
> There are no exploits in this projects. `Vulnerabilities != Exploits` A Vulnerability resides in the software itself, doing nothing on its own. If you are really curious about it youâ€™ll find **your own way** to discover a flow, this list aimed to help you **find it faster**.

Vulnerability Research is the process of analyzing a product, protocol, or algorithm - or set of related products to find, understand or exploit one or more vulnerabilities. Vulnerability research can but does not always involve reverse engineering, code review, static and dynamic analysis, fuzzing and debugging.

## Purpose

Currently, there is **way more** insecure code out there than researchers. Much more people looking at code thatâ€™s deployed in the real world are required by the market. This project exists to share a different awesome sources of information with you and encourage more people to get involved. Here you will find books and articles, online classes, recommended tools, write-ups, methodologies and tutorials, people to follow, and more cool stuff about Vulnerability Research and tinkering with application execution flow in general.

## Contributing

This List is published according to the *"Done is better than Perfect"* approach, so your contributions and suggestions are very valuable and are always welcome! There are two options:
1. Use the standard method of forking this repo, making your changes and [doing a pull request](https://github.com/serhii-pronin/awesome-vulnerability-research/pulls) to have your content added. Please check the [Contributing Guideline](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
2. Occasionally, if you just want to copy/paste your content, I'll take that too! [Create an "Issue"](https://github.com/serhii-pronin/awesome-vulnerability-research/issues) with your suggestions and I will add it for you.
